One person from each project team must turn the following into
the handin directory "project-final" by 11:59 pm March 27 - the full command is
"handin cs304 project-final", which assumes that the files that you are
submitting are in a directory called ~/cs304/project-final. To do so, you'll
need to_get_an_account_on_the_CS_ugrad_machines.

    * A cover_page (TODO)
    * All the code used in the application (done)
    * A script that could be used to create all tables and data in the database
      such as the one here (done)
    * A short description of what the project accomplished (TODO)
    * A description of how your final schema differed from the schema you
      turned in. If the final schema differed, why? Note that turning in a
      final schema that's different from what you planned is fine, we just want
      to know what changed and why. (TODO)
    * A list of the SQL queries used (TODO)
    * List all functional dependencies that are applicable to the table
      (including the ones involving the primary key). For each functional
      dependency, briefly describe its meaning in English. (TODO)
