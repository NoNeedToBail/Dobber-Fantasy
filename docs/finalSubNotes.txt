* A cover_page (TODO)
* All the code used in the application (done)
* A script that could be used to create all tables and data in the database
such as the one here (done)
* A short description of what the project accomplished (TODO)
* A description of how your final schema differed FROM the schema you
turned inIf the final schema differed, why? Note that turning in a
final schema that's different FROM what you planned is fine, we just want
to know what changed and why(TODO)

* List all functional dependencies that are applicable to the table
(including the ones involving the primary key)For each functional
dependency, briefly describe its meaning in English(TODO)
