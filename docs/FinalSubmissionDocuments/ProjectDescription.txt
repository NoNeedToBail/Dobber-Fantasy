For this project we have created a working fantasy hockey league management system, Dobber Fantasy. 
Users are able to sign up/login to Dobber Fantasy, join a league, create their team, add players, drop players and see their stats and how they place within the league. 
They can also look at information on all of the players. 
Users can manage leagues and edit or delete the leagues that they manage. 
Administrators can see and edit or delete all leagues, users and players. They can also see whether a player is owned in every league.
